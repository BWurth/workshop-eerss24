# EERSS24 Workshop: Introduction to SD and ABM
This repository contains the slides and all simulation files for the 'Introduction to SD and ABM' workshop at the Entrepreneurship Ecosystem Research Spring School 2024 in Stuttgart.
## Project Structure
This repository contains the slides in the main folder (`Workshop_Intro_SD_ABM_Wurth_EERSS24.pdf`) and is otherwise organized around the exercises and practice sections. Here is an overview of the folders in alphabetical order:
- `/agentpy_skeleton`: Contains a `main.py` file that can serve as a starting point for your own ABM in Python using the AgentPy package.
- `/exercise_sd_1`: Solutions for the in-class exercise of linking variables and constructing a CLD and SFD (Vensim files).
- `/practice_abm`: The two examples shown at the end using a network-approach to link agents (Python file) and random walks (NetLogo).
- `/practice_sd`: Contains the Vensim file, including all parameters and equations to simulate the diffusion model shown at the end of the SD section.
## Software
The simulations based on Vensim (SD) and NetLogo and Python (ABM). Files for Vensim and NetLogo are sufficient on their own, the Python files need to be embedded in a project.
## Let's collaborate!
If you have any questions, want to discuss your research and how a complex systems perspective and simulation might help, or are interested in exploring new avenues for future research, please get in touch.
